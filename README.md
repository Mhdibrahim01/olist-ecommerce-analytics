📊 Olist E-Commerce Analytics: Strategic SQL Audit📌 Project OverviewThis repository contains a comprehensive SQL-based business intelligence audit of the Olist E-Commerce dataset (100k+ Brazilian orders). The project moves beyond basic querying to provide a deep-dive analysis of revenue growth, logistics efficiency, and customer lifetime value (LTV).🚀 Key Business Questions AnsweredGrowth: How has our revenue scaled month-over-month since launch?Efficiency: Where are the bottlenecks in our Brazilian logistics network?Loyalty: Who are our "Whales" and how do we segment our customer base?Supply: How dependent is our revenue on a small group of "Super Sellers"?🛠️ Technical StackLanguage: PostgreSQLTechniques: * Advanced Window Functions: NTILE(), LAG(), DENSE_RANK(), SUM() OVER()Complex CTEs: Multi-layered logic for growth and segmentation.Data Transformation: STRING_AGG(), COALESCE(), DATE_PART(), TO_CHAR().Business Logic: RFM Modeling and MoM growth velocity.📂 Project Structure: The "Big 8" QueriesFileAnalysis PhaseStrategic Value01_top_categories.sqlProductIdentifies Health & Beauty as the #1 revenue driver (~$1.2M).02_annual_running_total.sqlSalesTracks the 2017 growth journey from $112k to $6M cumulative.03_logistics_performance.sqlOperationsMaps the 12-day "Logistics Gap" between São Paulo and remote states.04_seller_concentration.sqlSupply ChainHighlights that 13% of revenue depends on a core group of 10 sellers.05_statistical_rfm.sqlMarketingStatistically segments users into Champions vs. At-Risk via NTILE.06_high_value_whales.sqlDeep DiveInvestigates the top 20 spenders (identifying $13k single-order leads).07_mom_growth_velocity.sqlGrowthCalculates MoM revenue/AOV growth using LAG() functions.08_loyalty_tier_audit.sqlRetentionRule-based VIP vs. One-time segmentation and Lifetime Value.📈 Executive Summary of Insights1. The "Plateau" WarningThe MoM Growth Analysis (Script 7) reveals that while 2017 saw triple-digit growth, 2018 shows a stabilizing trend (0-15%). The business has moved from "Blitzscaling" to a "Mature" phase, requiring a shift in focus from new acquisition to margin optimization.2. The Logistics "Standard"Delivery performance is highly localized. São Paulo serves as the operational benchmark (8.7 days), while northern states face a "Geography Penalty" exceeding 20 days. Improving the logistics network in these lagging states could increase overall CSAT by an estimated 15%.3. The 97% Retention GapAcross both RFM and Loyalty Tier audits (Scripts 5 & 8), the data reveals a critical bottleneck: 97% of customers are one-time buyers. Olist acts as a "Discovery Engine," but lacks a "Retention Loop."4. High-Ticket ConcentrationThe "Whale" Analysis (Script 6) shows that our top spenders aren't just frequent shoppers—they are primarily one-time buyers of high-end tech and computers. This suggests a B2B or high-end consumer segment that could be targeted with specific financing or insurance products.💡 Strategic RecommendationsThe "Second Order" Incentive: Convert Potential Loyalists (2 orders) into Champions (3+ orders) by offering high-value discount codes within 30 days of the first delivery.Seller Diversification: Reduce platform risk by incentivizing high-performing sellers in São Paulo to utilize regional distribution centers.Logistics Transparency: Implement "Arrival Predictions" for northern states to manage customer expectations and reduce the negative impact of long delivery windows on review scores.
